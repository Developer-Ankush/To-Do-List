## 🔧 Customization

The duck sound is generated programmatically. To customize:
```javascript
// In createDuckSound() function
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(800, audioContext.currentTime);
// Change 800 to different frequency for different pitch
```

### Change Color Scheme
Update CSS variables for quick theme changes:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #667eea;
  --secondary-color: #764ba2;
  --success-color: #4caf50;
  --warning-color: #ff9800;
  --danger-color: #f44336;
}
```

### Adjust Timer Limits
